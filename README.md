# Fibonacci

My implementation of fibonacci using iteration and recursion, built with Ruby.
More information about fibonacci on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number).

## Methods

#fibs(integer) => array<br>
Returns an array, containing the Fibonacci sequence, up until the term n.

#fibs_rec(integer) => array<br>
Solves the same problem as #fibs using recursion.
